**Project Objective Description:**

This repository contains the final project of the 'Robotics Bootcamp' held by CAREAWARE LLC.

The main goal of the project was to detect if a person in the video fell or not. For that purpose, each image inside the whole timeframe was analyzed, and a human skeleton was reconstructed via Pose Estimation. Afterwards, the angle between different joints of the human skeleton was calculated for each timeframe, and the fall detection score was calculated.

It was also made possible to write the fall score on the video for each timeframe.

The main code can be found in the fall_detection.py file.

Frameworks used during project: NumPy, PyTorch.
Paradigms used during project: OOP.
